The backend of the Streamlit app in nomic AI contains embeddings of most of the literature texts taught in the Singapore Sports School. The app does a vector similarity search using nomic AI engine, and feed relevant contexts to ChatGPT turbo 3.5 for writing a literary response. The app itself (in a private repo) is loaded on Streamlit community cloud.

The other program files here include files to preprocess the texts, convert them to embeddings using OpenAI API and upload to Nomic AI for vector storage and processing.
